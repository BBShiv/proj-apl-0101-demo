Cyber threats comprise a wide variety of activities and behaviors that can be distinguished \\nby the types of actors behind them and their motives. Actors range from nation-states to criminal \\norganizations and private persons or combinations thereof. The affiliation and goals of actors can inform \\nhow aggressively they behave, how sophisticated attacks are, which methods are used and who is targeted. \\nCyber threats can be direct or indirect, depending on the target. Direct cyber threats, which target \\nhumanitarian organizations, have increased in recent years. Indirect cyber threats target the infrastructure \\nor services that people affected by or responding to humanitarian crises rely on for survival and aid \\ndelivery.\\nCyber threats can also be classified according to their type or mode. These include Denial-of-service (DoS) \\nand Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,15 malware,16 and ransomware,17 among others. \\nThe following examples illustrate what cyber threats might look like in practice: \\n•\\t Cyber warfare refers to ‘operations against a computer, a computer system or network, or another \\nconnected device, through a data stream, when used as means or methods of warfare in the context \\nof an armed conflict’.18 In Ukraine, cyber-attacks have undermined the distribution of medicines, food \\nand relief supplies since February 2022.19 Their impact has ranged from preventing access to basic \\nservices to data theft and disinformation.\\n•\\t Misinformation, disinformation and hate speech (MDH) refers to the organized dissemination \\n(intentional or unintentional) of false information through means of ICT which discredits political, \\nmilitary or civil society actors, or spreads, incites, promotes or justifies hatred and violence based on \\nintolerance. In Myanmar, a campaign of MDH with derogatory and dehumanizing language against the \\nRohingya Muslim minority of the country has been linked to the commission of grave human rights \\nviolations.20\\n \\n•\\t Cybercrime refers to criminal offenses that are cyber-enabled (committed through the means of ICT) \\nor cyber-dependent (only possible because of ICT). \\n•\\t Cyber sabotage refers to activities aiming to disrupt or destroy the reliable and error-free functioning \\nof ICT. If an act of sabotage is carried out by perpetrators with terrorist motives, it is referred to as \\ncyber terrorism.'),\n",

These include \\ninfrastructure flaws, inadequate basic cybersecurity and digital literacy, human error and the absence of a \\ncoordinated approach. \\n1.\\t Infrastructure flaws\\nCyber threats are commonly associated with sophisticated technical operations targeting vulnerabilities \\nin information infrastructure.21 Common vulnerabilities of this type relevant to the humanitarian sector \\ninclude: \\n•\\t Legacy systems: Outdated computing software and/or hardware that are unable to resist \\ncontemporary forms of attack, and present a risk for other applications and data that may share the \\nsame infrastructure.22\\n•\\t Default or improper configuration: Out-of-box systems, i.e., with default or simple passwords and \\noverly permissive configurations are easier for attackers to compromise.23\\n \\n•\\t Lack of encryption: In the absence of encryption, attackers can use software to discover usernames \\nand passwords. A lack of encryption means that an attacker can access the data on compromised \\ndevices. Data that is transferred via unencrypted channels is also at risk of unauthorized access. \\n•\\t Third-party infrastructure: Attackers can infiltrate ICT systems through an outside partner or \\nvendor by exploiting different vulnerabilities.24 Attackers may also gain access to the data stored by \\nproviders. Disruption of critical infrastructure through cyber operations can lead to a shutdown of \\nessential services, which can have grave consequences for people in need and disrupt humanitarian \\noperations.25 Vendor lock-in due to product incompatibilities, low levels of interoperability or \\nportability, or limited alternatives in the market are also major concerns.26\\n2.\\t Inadequate basic cybersecurity and digital literacy\\nCybersecurity preparedness, organizational readiness and digital literacy remain limited in the \\nhumanitarian sector.27 Inadequate data literacy, and a lack of consistent practices and tools to ensure \\ncybersecurity are widespread among humanitarian organizations. Cybersecurity continues to be seen as a \\npredominantly technical issue, leading to little engagement from staff or leadership to raise awareness of \\nthreats and equip people across organizations with the skills and tools required to mitigate risk. This lack \\nof engagement and focus also translates into a lack of resources and funding for cybersecurity.28 Even as \\nhumanitarian actors digitalize their operations, gaps remain between the investment in the front end of \\ntechnology (building it, deploying it, and closing out the project), and the back end (maintaining services \\nand keeping information secure and protected over time).29'),\n",

Most of these \\ntechniques are designed to reach a high number of users simultaneously, maximizing the likelihood of a \\nbreach. These intrusions can go undetected for extended periods of time, giving attackers access to internal \\nsecurity architecture and confidential information, which in turn offers further opportunities for attack.\\nHuman error that increases vulnerability to cyber threats may include: \\n•\\t accidental abuse by users with authorized and legitimate access to computer systems;\\n•\\t unauthorized use by attackers enabled by a compromised user;\\n \\n•\\t disregard by personnel for security policies and procedures; and \\n•\\t errors in the configuration or operation of systems.\\n4.\\t Absence of coordinated approach\\nThere is an acute gap in coordination on cyber-related issues in the humanitarian sector. This gap exists \\nboth within and between organizations. Few organizations have teams dedicated to cybersecurity or tasked \\nwith detecting, assessing and mitigating cyber risks. No single entity is formally tasked with coordinating \\na harmonized approach to cybersecurity in the sector, despite the existence of initiatives such as the ones \\ndescribed above, the development of resources and apparent political will.32 \\nThe lack of coordination means that organizations lack visibility on attacks experienced by their peers, are \\nunable or do not have policies in place to consistently share information on experienced cyber threats or \\nlessons learned, and are not investing in collective approaches to reducing vulnerabilities and mitigating \\nrisk.33\\nHUMANITARIAN IMPLICATIONS OF CYBER THREATS\\nThe humanitarian implications of cyber threats are significant. They can compromise the ability to deliver \\nassistance and protection, as well as exacerbate humanitarian needs by disrupting services essential \\nfor survival. Cyber threats can result in surveillance, discrimination, persecution and other harmful \\nconsequences for affected populations, exacerbate the insecurities of already vulnerable groups and \\nindividuals, erode trust and compromise the principled delivery of humanitarian assistance.34\\nDelivering principled aid means that humanitarian services and assistance are aligned with the \\nprinciples of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.35 To act with neutrality in the digital \\nrealm, humanitarian actors ‘must ensure that the data and systems they employ do not provide any \\ntactical military or operational advantage to parties engaged in hostilities’.36 The humanitarian principle \\nof independence might be in conflict with the dependence of ICT-supported humanitarian work on \\ninfrastructure owned and managed by private companies affiliated with different states. The overarching \\nprinciple of ‘Do No Harm’ further obliges all humanitarians to avoid exposing people to additional risks'),\n",

As the technical tools \\nfor managing data in these different areas have evolved faster than the policy instruments that govern their \\nuse, organizations must exercise caution as they design and deploy digital technologies. The sections below \\noffer considerations to help organizations better understand and address the humanitarian implications of \\ncyber threats across these domains.\\n1.\\t Protection \\nFor humanitarian organizations, protection entails advocating for and supporting actions that aim to \\nreduce and prevent people’s exposure to risks and to ensure respect for the rights of individuals by those \\nresponsible.38 Humanitarians must consider how cyber threats and related vulnerabilities impact their \\nprotection responsibilities, what effects technology might have on the distribution of resources, and how \\nreliance on cyber infrastructure and vendors is redefining relationships.39 \\nInformation about the location of vulnerable people, as well as data that allows for re-identification \\nof victims of gender-based violence are two examples of protection-specific concerns that might be \\nexacerbated by the use of ICT as they might render such information more easily accessible to threat \\nactors.40 Another protection concern is that of the protection of humanitarian data. For example, the use of \\nsocial media has become more commonplace in the delivery of services, but this brings with it a number of \\nsignificant data protection risks such as profiling.41 \\n2.\\t Access \\nHumanitarian access refers to both humanitarian actors’ ability to reach populations in need and affected \\npopulations’ ability to access assistance and services.42 \\nThe use of ICT can help increase and simplify beneficiaries’ access to humanitarian services such as cash \\nassistance, referral services or healthcare. The increased reliance by humanitarians on digital technologies, \\nand the related dependencies on external and internal infrastructure and services, can however bring new \\nchallenges. \\nAccess to services can be impeded by the inherent vulnerabilities of the sectors on which organizations \\nand beneficiaries rely (such as healthcare, logistics, banking, and more).43 The continuity of services in the \\ndigital space is not always a given—internet shutdowns and network failures can cause major disruptions \\nto the provision of essential services.44 In Kenya, such a network failure led to ‘occasional delays, disruption \\nor cancellation of the food distribution in the camps, contributing to long queues and crowd control \\nchallenges’.45'),\n",

They violate the privacy of the people whose data is compromised, \\nrisk exposing sensitive information about them and erode trust in humanitarian organizations’ capabilities. \\nIn response to these attacks, a number of new initiatives signal increased investment in this area. For \\nexample, ICRC is considering the development of a ‘digital emblem’9 and has also opened a new delegation \\nfor cyberspace in Luxembourg.10 NetHope has established an Information Sharing and Analysis Center that \\nwill help support the information security needs of nonprofit agencies and the world’s most vulnerable \\ncommunities.11 However, the sector lacks a shared approach to mitigating the risk and potential impact of \\ncyber threats.\\nThis Guidance Note aims to help build a common understanding and support more strategic, collective \\naction within the sector. It provides an overview of the cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and implications \\nfacing humanitarians and people affected by crises, and offers recommendations to increase cyber \\nresilience within and across organizations and their partners.\\nDefinitions\\nCybersecurity entails a combination of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, \\nrisk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be \\nused to protect the cyber environment, and organization and user assets against relevant security risks in \\nthe cyber environment.12 \\nInformation and data security entails a set of physical, technological and procedural measures that \\nsafeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, and prevent its accidental or intentional, \\nunlawful or otherwise unauthorized loss, destruction, alteration, acquisition or disclosure.13 \\nCyber threats encompass ‘activities that occur at least in part within the cyber realm, utilizing and/or \\ntargeting information communications technologies to achieve an effect that is not authorized by the \\nlegitimate user of the data or the ICT and/or has a harmful intent or effect on the victim or victims’.14\\nCyber resilience refers to an organization’s capacity to identify, prevent and detect cyber threats, and \\nrespond and recover.OCHA CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\n3\\nMARCH 2023\\n15  Denial-of-service (DoS) and Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks flood a system’s resources, overwhelming them and preventing responses to \\n     service requests, which reduces the system’s ability to perform.

Cyber threats comprise a wide variety of activities and behaviors that can be distinguished \\nby the types of actors behind them and their motives. Actors range from nation-states to criminal \\norganizations and private persons or combinations thereof. The affiliation and goals of actors can inform \\nhow aggressively they behave, how sophisticated attacks are, which methods are used and who is targeted. \\nCyber threats can be direct or indirect, depending on the target. Direct cyber threats, which target \\nhumanitarian organizations, have increased in recent years. Indirect cyber threats target the infrastructure \\nor services that people affected by or responding to humanitarian crises rely on for survival and aid \\ndelivery.\\nCyber threats can also be classified according to their type or mode. These include Denial-of-service (DoS) \\nand Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,15 malware,16 and ransomware,17 among others. \\nThe following examples illustrate what cyber threats might look like in practice: \\n•\\t Cyber warfare refers to ‘operations against a computer, a computer system or network, or another \\nconnected device, through a data stream, when used as means or methods of warfare in the context \\nof an armed conflict’.18 In Ukraine, cyber-attacks have undermined the distribution of medicines, food \\nand relief supplies since February 2022.19 Their impact has ranged from preventing access to basic \\nservices to data theft and disinformation.\\n•\\t Misinformation, disinformation and hate speech (MDH) refers to the organized dissemination \\n(intentional or unintentional) of false information through means of ICT which discredits political, \\nmilitary or civil society actors, or spreads, incites, promotes or justifies hatred and violence based on \\nintolerance. In Myanmar, a campaign of MDH with derogatory and dehumanizing language against the \\nRohingya Muslim minority of the country has been linked to the commission of grave human rights \\nviolations.20\\n \\n•\\t Cybercrime refers to criminal offenses that are cyber-enabled (committed through the means of ICT) \\nor cyber-dependent (only possible because of ICT). \\n•\\t Cyber sabotage refers to activities aiming to disrupt or destroy the reliable and error-free functioning \\nof ICT.

These include \\ninfrastructure flaws, inadequate basic cybersecurity and digital literacy, human error and the absence of a \\ncoordinated approach. \\n1.\\t Infrastructure flaws\\nCyber threats are commonly associated with sophisticated technical operations targeting vulnerabilities \\nin information infrastructure.21 Common vulnerabilities of this type relevant to the humanitarian sector \\ninclude: \\n•\\t Legacy systems: Outdated computing software and/or hardware that are unable to resist \\ncontemporary forms of attack, and present a risk for other applications and data that may share the \\nsame infrastructure.22\\n•\\t Default or improper configuration: Out-of-box systems, i.e., with default or simple passwords and \\noverly permissive configurations are easier for attackers to compromise.23\\n \\n•\\t Lack of encryption: In the absence of encryption, attackers can use software to discover usernames \\nand passwords. A lack of encryption means that an attacker can access the data on compromised \\ndevices. Data that is transferred via unencrypted channels is also at risk of unauthorized access. \\n•\\t Third-party infrastructure: Attackers can infiltrate ICT systems through an outside partner or \\nvendor by exploiting different vulnerabilities.24 Attackers may also gain access to the data stored by \\nproviders. Disruption of critical infrastructure through cyber operations can lead to a shutdown of \\nessential services, which can have grave consequences for people in need and disrupt humanitarian \\noperations.25 Vendor lock-in due to product incompatibilities, low levels of interoperability or \\nportability, or limited alternatives in the market are also major concerns.26\\n2.\\t Inadequate basic cybersecurity and digital literacy\\nCybersecurity preparedness, organizational readiness and digital literacy remain limited in the \\nhumanitarian sector.27 Inadequate data literacy, and a lack of consistent practices and tools to ensure \\ncybersecurity are widespread among humanitarian organizations. Cybersecurity continues to be seen as a \\npredominantly technical issue, leading to little engagement from staff or leadership to raise awareness of \\nthreats and equip people across organizations with the skills and tools required to mitigate risk. This lack \\nof engagement and focus also translates into a lack of resources and funding for cybersecurity.28 Even as \\nhumanitarian actors digitalize their operations, gaps remain between the investment in the front end of \\ntechnology (building it, deploying it, and closing out the project), and the back end (maintaining services \\nand keeping information secure and protected over time).29OCHA CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\n5\\nMARCH 2023\\n30 UN (2021).

Most of these \\ntechniques are designed to reach a high number of users simultaneously, maximizing the likelihood of a \\nbreach. These intrusions can go undetected for extended periods of time, giving attackers access to internal \\nsecurity architecture and confidential information, which in turn offers further opportunities for attack.\\nHuman error that increases vulnerability to cyber threats may include: \\n•\\t accidental abuse by users with authorized and legitimate access to computer systems;\\n•\\t unauthorized use by attackers enabled by a compromised user;\\n \\n•\\t disregard by personnel for security policies and procedures; and \\n•\\t errors in the configuration or operation of systems.\\n4.\\t Absence of coordinated approach\\nThere is an acute gap in coordination on cyber-related issues in the humanitarian sector. This gap exists \\nboth within and between organizations. Few organizations have teams dedicated to cybersecurity or tasked \\nwith detecting, assessing and mitigating cyber risks. No single entity is formally tasked with coordinating \\na harmonized approach to cybersecurity in the sector, despite the existence of initiatives such as the ones \\ndescribed above, the development of resources and apparent political will.32 \\nThe lack of coordination means that organizations lack visibility on attacks experienced by their peers, are \\nunable or do not have policies in place to consistently share information on experienced cyber threats or \\nlessons learned, and are not investing in collective approaches to reducing vulnerabilities and mitigating \\nrisk.33\\nHUMANITARIAN IMPLICATIONS OF CYBER THREATS\\nThe humanitarian implications of cyber threats are significant. They can compromise the ability to deliver \\nassistance and protection, as well as exacerbate humanitarian needs by disrupting services essential \\nfor survival. Cyber threats can result in surveillance, discrimination, persecution and other harmful \\nconsequences for affected populations, exacerbate the insecurities of already vulnerable groups and \\nindividuals, erode trust and compromise the principled delivery of humanitarian assistance.34\\nDelivering principled aid means that humanitarian services and assistance are aligned with the \\nprinciples of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.35 To act with neutrality in the digital \\nrealm, humanitarian actors ‘must ensure that the data and systems they employ do not provide any \\ntactical military or operational advantage to parties engaged in hostilities’.36 The humanitarian principle \\nof independence might be in conflict with the dependence of ICT-supported humanitarian work on \\ninfrastructure owned and managed by private companies affiliated with different states.

As the technical tools \\nfor managing data in these different areas have evolved faster than the policy instruments that govern their \\nuse, organizations must exercise caution as they design and deploy digital technologies. The sections below \\noffer considerations to help organizations better understand and address the humanitarian implications of \\ncyber threats across these domains.\\n1.\\t Protection \\nFor humanitarian organizations, protection entails advocating for and supporting actions that aim to \\nreduce and prevent people’s exposure to risks and to ensure respect for the rights of individuals by those \\nresponsible.38 Humanitarians must consider how cyber threats and related vulnerabilities impact their \\nprotection responsibilities, what effects technology might have on the distribution of resources, and how \\nreliance on cyber infrastructure and vendors is redefining relationships.39 \\nInformation about the location of vulnerable people, as well as data that allows for re-identification \\nof victims of gender-based violence are two examples of protection-specific concerns that might be \\nexacerbated by the use of ICT as they might render such information more easily accessible to threat \\nactors.40 Another protection concern is that of the protection of humanitarian data. For example, the use of \\nsocial media has become more commonplace in the delivery of services, but this brings with it a number of \\nsignificant data protection risks such as profiling.41 \\n2.\\t Access \\nHumanitarian access refers to both humanitarian actors’ ability to reach populations in need and affected \\npopulations’ ability to access assistance and services.42 \\nThe use of ICT can help increase and simplify beneficiaries’ access to humanitarian services such as cash \\nassistance, referral services or healthcare. The increased reliance by humanitarians on digital technologies, \\nand the related dependencies on external and internal infrastructure and services, can however bring new \\nchallenges. \\nAccess to services can be impeded by the inherent vulnerabilities of the sectors on which organizations \\nand beneficiaries rely (such as healthcare, logistics, banking, and more).43 The continuity of services in the \\ndigital space is not always a given—internet shutdowns and network failures can cause major disruptions \\nto the provision of essential services.44 In Kenya, such a network failure led to ‘occasional delays, disruption \\nor cancellation of the food distribution in the camps, contributing to long queues and crowd control \\nchallenges’.45OCHA CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\n7\\nMARCH 2023\\n46 IASC: Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) : A brief overview.\\n47 OCHA (2014).

Cybersecurity in the United Nations system organizations: Report of the Joint Inspection Unit.\\n3.\\t Accountability to affected people and communications with communities \\nAccountability to affected people is an active commitment to use power responsibly by taking account of, \\ngiving account to, and being held to account by the people humanitarian organizations seek to assist.46 \\nCommunications with Communities aims to meet the information and communications needs of people \\naffected by crisis.47\\nEnsuring timely and reliable access to and use of information is paramount to AAP and CwC. Increasingly, \\nhumanitarians provide this information at least in part through digital channels, either to complement \\nface-to-face services or where physical proximity to communities is not feasible. This dependency on digital \\nservices means that cyber operations stand to have grave humanitarian repercussions. \\nOne particular threat related to AAP and CwC is misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, which \\nhas become more prevalent with the increased use of ICT.48 MDH can put affected communities and \\nhumanitarian workers at risk by further destabilizing fragile environments, increasing vulnerability and \\naffecting humanitarian organizations’ reputation.49\\nRecommendations\\nHumanitarian organizations should consider the following recommendations to improve cyber resilience.\\nInvest in cybersecurity as a cross-organizational issue by:\\n•\\t Integrating cybersecurity into broader organizational frameworks and strategies, including relevant \\nlegal, technical and operational safeguards. \\n \\n•\\t Promoting an active stance from staff at all levels through awareness-raising programmes and \\ndisplaying an engaged leadership style on cybersecurity matters overall.50\\n•\\t Allocating appropriate long-term and flexible funding for cybersecurity and data responsibility as an \\nintegral component of humanitarian programming. \\n•\\t Advocating for increased investment into the responsible operations of digital technologies to reduce \\nrelated vulnerabilities.\\nEnhance institutional preparedness by:\\n•\\t Identifying and analyzing common cybersecurity challenges including identifying potential threats \\nand threat actors specific to their work, as well as the potential vulnerabilities in their operations and \\nsystems.\\n•\\t Conducting regular risk assessments to identify threats and vulnerabilities, particularly when planning \\nnew cyber-enabled activities or exploring new technologies to support activities.\\n•\\t Implementing several mitigation measures, such as putting in place security standards for hardware \\nand software, and adopting a ‘zero trust’ approach that favors restrictions such as least-privilege \\naccess, microsegmentation and multi-factor authentication. \\n•\\t Diversifying supply chains to remove strong supplier dependencies, and considering free and open \\nsource alternatives (as long as they are approved or appropriately vetted).\\n•\\t Developing and adapting existing technologies to humanitarian situations, and ensuring \\ncontextualized tailoring, testing, efficacy and safety before deployment.OCHA CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\n8\\nMARCH 2023\\n51  Centre for Humanitarian Data (2019).

Actors range from nation-states to criminal \\norganizations and private persons or combinations thereof. The affiliation and goals of actors can inform \\nhow aggressively they behave, how sophisticated attacks are, which methods are used and who is targeted. \\nCyber threats can be direct or indirect, depending on the target. Direct cyber threats, which target \\nhumanitarian organizations, have increased in recent years. Indirect cyber threats target the infrastructure \\nor services that people affected by or responding to humanitarian crises rely on for survival and aid \\ndelivery.\\nCyber threats can also be classified according to their type or mode. These include Denial-of-service (DoS) \\nand Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,15 malware,16 and ransomware,17 among others. \\nThe following examples illustrate what cyber threats might look like in practice: \\n•\\t Cyber warfare refers to ‘operations against a computer, a computer system or network, or another \\nconnected device, through a data stream, when used as means or methods of warfare in the context \\nof an armed conflict’.18 In Ukraine, cyber-attacks have undermined the distribution of medicines, food \\nand relief supplies since February 2022.19 Their impact has ranged from preventing access to basic \\nservices to data theft and disinformation.\\n•\\t Misinformation, disinformation and hate speech (MDH) refers to the organized dissemination \\n(intentional or unintentional) of false information through means of ICT which discredits political, \\nmilitary or civil society actors, or spreads, incites, promotes or justifies hatred and violence based on \\nintolerance. In Myanmar, a campaign of MDH with derogatory and dehumanizing language against the \\nRohingya Muslim minority of the country has been linked to the commission of grave human rights \\nviolations.20\\n \\n•\\t Cybercrime refers to criminal offenses that are cyber-enabled (committed through the means of ICT) \\nor cyber-dependent (only possible because of ICT). \\n•\\t Cyber sabotage refers to activities aiming to disrupt or destroy the reliable and error-free functioning \\nof ICT. If an act of sabotage is carried out by perpetrators with terrorist motives, it is referred to as \\ncyber terrorism.'),\n",

Delivering digital aid when the internet becomes a weapon of war, DevEx, 28 January.\\nCOMMON VULNERABILITIES IN THE HUMANITARIAN SECTOR \\nHumanitarian actors should investigate and understand potential vulnerabilities that might impact their \\ncyber resilience, and make them more susceptible to becoming victims of cyber threats. These include \\ninfrastructure flaws, inadequate basic cybersecurity and digital literacy, human error and the absence of a \\ncoordinated approach. \\n1.\\t Infrastructure flaws\\nCyber threats are commonly associated with sophisticated technical operations targeting vulnerabilities \\nin information infrastructure.21 Common vulnerabilities of this type relevant to the humanitarian sector \\ninclude: \\n•\\t Legacy systems: Outdated computing software and/or hardware that are unable to resist \\ncontemporary forms of attack, and present a risk for other applications and data that may share the \\nsame infrastructure.22\\n•\\t Default or improper configuration: Out-of-box systems, i.e., with default or simple passwords and \\noverly permissive configurations are easier for attackers to compromise.23\\n \\n•\\t Lack of encryption: In the absence of encryption, attackers can use software to discover usernames \\nand passwords. A lack of encryption means that an attacker can access the data on compromised \\ndevices. Data that is transferred via unencrypted channels is also at risk of unauthorized access. \\n•\\t Third-party infrastructure: Attackers can infiltrate ICT systems through an outside partner or \\nvendor by exploiting different vulnerabilities.24 Attackers may also gain access to the data stored by \\nproviders. Disruption of critical infrastructure through cyber operations can lead to a shutdown of \\nessential services, which can have grave consequences for people in need and disrupt humanitarian \\noperations.25 Vendor lock-in due to product incompatibilities, low levels of interoperability or \\nportability, or limited alternatives in the market are also major concerns.26\\n2.\\t Inadequate basic cybersecurity and digital literacy\\nCybersecurity preparedness, organizational readiness and digital literacy remain limited in the \\nhumanitarian sector.27 Inadequate data literacy, and a lack of consistent practices and tools to ensure \\ncybersecurity are widespread among humanitarian organizations. Cybersecurity continues to be seen as a \\npredominantly technical issue, leading to little engagement from staff or leadership to raise awareness of \\nthreats and equip people across organizations with the skills and tools required to mitigate risk. This lack \\nof engagement and focus also translates into a lack of resources and funding for cybersecurity.28 Even as \\nhumanitarian actors digitalize their operations, gaps remain between the investment in the front end of \\ntechnology (building it, deploying it, and closing out the project), and the back end (maintaining services \\nand keeping information secure and protected over time).29'),\n",

Most of these \\ntechniques are designed to reach a high number of users simultaneously, maximizing the likelihood of a \\nbreach. These intrusions can go undetected for extended periods of time, giving attackers access to internal \\nsecurity architecture and confidential information, which in turn offers further opportunities for attack.\\nHuman error that increases vulnerability to cyber threats may include: \\n•\\t accidental abuse by users with authorized and legitimate access to computer systems;\\n•\\t unauthorized use by attackers enabled by a compromised user;\\n \\n•\\t disregard by personnel for security policies and procedures; and \\n•\\t errors in the configuration or operation of systems.\\n4.\\t Absence of coordinated approach\\nThere is an acute gap in coordination on cyber-related issues in the humanitarian sector. This gap exists \\nboth within and between organizations. Few organizations have teams dedicated to cybersecurity or tasked \\nwith detecting, assessing and mitigating cyber risks. No single entity is formally tasked with coordinating \\na harmonized approach to cybersecurity in the sector, despite the existence of initiatives such as the ones \\ndescribed above, the development of resources and apparent political will.32 \\nThe lack of coordination means that organizations lack visibility on attacks experienced by their peers, are \\nunable or do not have policies in place to consistently share information on experienced cyber threats or \\nlessons learned, and are not investing in collective approaches to reducing vulnerabilities and mitigating \\nrisk.33\\nHUMANITARIAN IMPLICATIONS OF CYBER THREATS\\nThe humanitarian implications of cyber threats are significant. They can compromise the ability to deliver \\nassistance and protection, as well as exacerbate humanitarian needs by disrupting services essential \\nfor survival. Cyber threats can result in surveillance, discrimination, persecution and other harmful \\nconsequences for affected populations, exacerbate the insecurities of already vulnerable groups and \\nindividuals, erode trust and compromise the principled delivery of humanitarian assistance.34\\nDelivering principled aid means that humanitarian services and assistance are aligned with the \\nprinciples of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.35 To act with neutrality in the digital \\nrealm, humanitarian actors ‘must ensure that the data and systems they employ do not provide any \\ntactical military or operational advantage to parties engaged in hostilities’.36 The humanitarian principle \\nof independence might be in conflict with the dependence of ICT-supported humanitarian work on \\ninfrastructure owned and managed by private companies affiliated with different states. The overarching \\nprinciple of ‘Do No Harm’ further obliges all humanitarians to avoid exposing people to additional risks'),\n",

As the technical tools \\nfor managing data in these different areas have evolved faster than the policy instruments that govern their \\nuse, organizations must exercise caution as they design and deploy digital technologies. The sections below \\noffer considerations to help organizations better understand and address the humanitarian implications of \\ncyber threats across these domains.\\n1.\\t Protection \\nFor humanitarian organizations, protection entails advocating for and supporting actions that aim to \\nreduce and prevent people’s exposure to risks and to ensure respect for the rights of individuals by those \\nresponsible.38 Humanitarians must consider how cyber threats and related vulnerabilities impact their \\nprotection responsibilities, what effects technology might have on the distribution of resources, and how \\nreliance on cyber infrastructure and vendors is redefining relationships.39 \\nInformation about the location of vulnerable people, as well as data that allows for re-identification \\nof victims of gender-based violence are two examples of protection-specific concerns that might be \\nexacerbated by the use of ICT as they might render such information more easily accessible to threat \\nactors.40 Another protection concern is that of the protection of humanitarian data. For example, the use of \\nsocial media has become more commonplace in the delivery of services, but this brings with it a number of \\nsignificant data protection risks such as profiling.41 \\n2.\\t Access \\nHumanitarian access refers to both humanitarian actors’ ability to reach populations in need and affected \\npopulations’ ability to access assistance and services.42 \\nThe use of ICT can help increase and simplify beneficiaries’ access to humanitarian services such as cash \\nassistance, referral services or healthcare. The increased reliance by humanitarians on digital technologies, \\nand the related dependencies on external and internal infrastructure and services, can however bring new \\nchallenges. \\nAccess to services can be impeded by the inherent vulnerabilities of the sectors on which organizations \\nand beneficiaries rely (such as healthcare, logistics, banking, and more).43 The continuity of services in the \\ndigital space is not always a given—internet shutdowns and network failures can cause major disruptions \\nto the provision of essential services.44 In Kenya, such a network failure led to ‘occasional delays, disruption \\nor cancellation of the food distribution in the camps, contributing to long queues and crowd control \\nchallenges’.45'),\n",

Increasingly, \\nhumanitarians provide this information at least in part through digital channels, either to complement \\nface-to-face services or where physical proximity to communities is not feasible. This dependency on digital \\nservices means that cyber operations stand to have grave humanitarian repercussions. \\nOne particular threat related to AAP and CwC is misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, which \\nhas become more prevalent with the increased use of ICT.48 MDH can put affected communities and \\nhumanitarian workers at risk by further destabilizing fragile environments, increasing vulnerability and \\naffecting humanitarian organizations’ reputation.49\\nRecommendations\\nHumanitarian organizations should consider the following recommendations to improve cyber resilience.\\nInvest in cybersecurity as a cross-organizational issue by:\\n•\\t Integrating cybersecurity into broader organizational frameworks and strategies, including relevant \\nlegal, technical and operational safeguards. \\n \\n•\\t Promoting an active stance from staff at all levels through awareness-raising programmes and \\ndisplaying an engaged leadership style on cybersecurity matters overall.50\\n•\\t Allocating appropriate long-term and flexible funding for cybersecurity and data responsibility as an \\nintegral component of humanitarian programming. \\n•\\t Advocating for increased investment into the responsible operations of digital technologies to reduce \\nrelated vulnerabilities.\\nEnhance institutional preparedness by:\\n•\\t Identifying and analyzing common cybersecurity challenges including identifying potential threats \\nand threat actors specific to their work, as well as the potential vulnerabilities in their operations and \\nsystems.\\n•\\t Conducting regular risk assessments to identify threats and vulnerabilities, particularly when planning \\nnew cyber-enabled activities or exploring new technologies to support activities.\\n•\\t Implementing several mitigation measures, such as putting in place security standards for hardware \\nand software, and adopting a ‘zero trust’ approach that favors restrictions such as least-privilege \\naccess, microsegmentation and multi-factor authentication. \\n•\\t Diversifying supply chains to remove strong supplier dependencies, and considering free and open \\nsource alternatives (as long as they are approved or appropriately vetted).\\n•\\t Developing and adapting existing technologies to humanitarian situations, and ensuring \\ncontextualized tailoring, testing, efficacy and safety before deployment.'),\n",

The affiliation and goals of actors can inform \\nhow aggressively they behave, how sophisticated attacks are, which methods are used and who is targeted. \\nCyber threats can be direct or indirect, depending on the target. Direct cyber threats, which target \\nhumanitarian organizations, have increased in recent years. Indirect cyber threats target the infrastructure \\nor services that people affected by or responding to humanitarian crises rely on for survival and aid \\ndelivery.\\nCyber threats can also be classified according to their type or mode. These include Denial-of-service (DoS) \\nand Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,15 malware,16 and ransomware,17 among others. \\nThe following examples illustrate what cyber threats might look like in practice: \\n•\\t Cyber warfare refers to ‘operations against a computer, a computer system or network, or another \\nconnected device, through a data stream, when used as means or methods of warfare in the context \\nof an armed conflict’.18 In Ukraine, cyber-attacks have undermined the distribution of medicines, food \\nand relief supplies since February 2022.19 Their impact has ranged from preventing access to basic \\nservices to data theft and disinformation.\\n•\\t Misinformation, disinformation and hate speech (MDH) refers to the organized dissemination \\n(intentional or unintentional) of false information through means of ICT which discredits political, \\nmilitary or civil society actors, or spreads, incites, promotes or justifies hatred and violence based on \\nintolerance. In Myanmar, a campaign of MDH with derogatory and dehumanizing language against the \\nRohingya Muslim minority of the country has been linked to the commission of grave human rights \\nviolations.20\\n \\n•\\t Cybercrime refers to criminal offenses that are cyber-enabled (committed through the means of ICT) \\nor cyber-dependent (only possible because of ICT). \\n•\\t Cyber sabotage refers to activities aiming to disrupt or destroy the reliable and error-free functioning \\nof ICT.

Most of these \\ntechniques are designed to reach a high number of users simultaneously, maximizing the likelihood of a \\nbreach. These intrusions can go undetected for extended periods of time, giving attackers access to internal \\nsecurity architecture and confidential information, which in turn offers further opportunities for attack.\\nHuman error that increases vulnerability to cyber threats may include: \\n•\\t accidental abuse by users with authorized and legitimate access to computer systems;\\n•\\t unauthorized use by attackers enabled by a compromised user;\\n \\n•\\t disregard by personnel for security policies and procedures; and \\n•\\t errors in the configuration or operation of systems.\\n4.\\t Absence of coordinated approach\\nThere is an acute gap in coordination on cyber-related issues in the humanitarian sector. This gap exists \\nboth within and between organizations. Few organizations have teams dedicated to cybersecurity or tasked \\nwith detecting, assessing and mitigating cyber risks. No single entity is formally tasked with coordinating \\na harmonized approach to cybersecurity in the sector, despite the existence of initiatives such as the ones \\ndescribed above, the development of resources and apparent political will.32 \\nThe lack of coordination means that organizations lack visibility on attacks experienced by their peers, are \\nunable or do not have policies in place to consistently share information on experienced cyber threats or \\nlessons learned, and are not investing in collective approaches to reducing vulnerabilities and mitigating \\nrisk.33\\nHUMANITARIAN IMPLICATIONS OF CYBER THREATS\\nThe humanitarian implications of cyber threats are significant. They can compromise the ability to deliver \\nassistance and protection, as well as exacerbate humanitarian needs by disrupting services essential \\nfor survival. Cyber threats can result in surveillance, discrimination, persecution and other harmful \\nconsequences for affected populations, exacerbate the insecurities of already vulnerable groups and \\nindividuals, erode trust and compromise the principled delivery of humanitarian assistance.34\\nDelivering principled aid means that humanitarian services and assistance are aligned with the \\nprinciples of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.35 To act with neutrality in the digital \\nrealm, humanitarian actors ‘must ensure that the data and systems they employ do not provide any \\ntactical military or operational advantage to parties engaged in hostilities’.36 The humanitarian principle \\nof independence might be in conflict with the dependence of ICT-supported humanitarian work on \\ninfrastructure owned and managed by private companies affiliated with different states. The overarching \\nprinciple of ‘Do No Harm’ further obliges all humanitarians to avoid exposing people to additional risks'"

These include Denial-of-service (DoS) \\nand Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,15 malware,16 and ransomware,17 among others. \\nThe following examples illustrate what cyber threats might look like in practice: \\n•\\t Cyber warfare refers to ‘operations against a computer, a computer system or network, or another \\nconnected device, through a data stream, when used as means or methods of warfare in the context \\nof an armed conflict’.18 In Ukraine, cyber-attacks have undermined the distribution of medicines, food \\nand relief supplies since February 2022.19 Their impact has ranged from preventing access to basic \\nservices to data theft and disinformation.\\n•\\t Misinformation, disinformation and hate speech (MDH) refers to the organized dissemination \\n(intentional or unintentional) of false information through means of ICT which discredits political, \\nmilitary or civil society actors, or spreads, incites, promotes or justifies hatred and violence based on \\nintolerance. In Myanmar, a campaign of MDH with derogatory and dehumanizing language against the \\nRohingya Muslim minority of the country has been linked to the commission of grave human rights \\nviolations.20\\n \\n•\\t Cybercrime refers to criminal offenses that are cyber-enabled (committed through the means of ICT) \\nor cyber-dependent (only possible because of ICT). \\n•\\t Cyber sabotage refers to activities aiming to disrupt or destroy the reliable and error-free functioning \\nof ICT. If an act of sabotage is carried out by perpetrators with terrorist motives, it is referred to as \\ncyber terrorism.\\n\\nOCHA CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\n2\\nMARCH 2023\\n5     Rebecca Root (2020).

Virtual Risk, Tangible Harm: The Humanitarian Implications of Cyber Threats.\\n•\\t In April 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mercy Corps and the International \\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) reported a drastic uptick in data protection \\nbreaches,5 and the World Health Organization (WHO) noted a fivefold increase in the number of cyber \\nthreats against the organization.6\\n•\\t In May 2021, hackers gained access to the email marketing account of the United States Agency for \\nInternational Development (USAID), emailing over 150 organizations in an apparent attempt to hack \\nthem.7 \\n•\\t In February 2022, a highly targeted cyber operation against servers of the International Committee \\nof the Red Cross (ICRC) which compromised sensitive data of more than 515,000 individuals was \\ndetected.8\\nThese attacks may cause serious harm. They violate the privacy of the people whose data is compromised, \\nrisk exposing sensitive information about them and erode trust in humanitarian organizations’ capabilities. \\nIn response to these attacks, a number of new initiatives signal increased investment in this area. For \\nexample, ICRC is considering the development of a ‘digital emblem’9 and has also opened a new delegation \\nfor cyberspace in Luxembourg.10 NetHope has established an Information Sharing and Analysis Center that \\nwill help support the information security needs of nonprofit agencies and the world’s most vulnerable \\ncommunities.11 However, the sector lacks a shared approach to mitigating the risk and potential impact of \\ncyber threats.\\nThis Guidance Note aims to help build a common understanding and support more strategic, collective \\naction within the sector. It provides an overview of the cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and implications \\nfacing humanitarians and people affected by crises, and offers recommendations to increase cyber \\nresilience within and across organizations and their partners.\\nDefinitions\\nCybersecurity entails a combination of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, \\nrisk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be \\nused to protect the cyber environment, and organization and user assets against relevant security risks in \\nthe cyber environment.12 \\nInformation and data security entails a set of physical, technological and procedural measures that \\nsafeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, and prevent its accidental or intentional, \\nunlawful or otherwise unauthorized loss, destruction, alteration, acquisition or disclosure.13 \\nCyber threats encompass ‘activities that occur at least in part within the cyber realm, utilizing and/or \\ntargeting information communications technologies to achieve an effect that is not authorized by the \\nlegitimate user of the data or the ICT and/or has a harmful intent or effect on the victim or victims’.14\\nCyber resilience refers to an organization’s capacity to identify, prevent and detect cyber threats, and \\nrespond and recover.\\n\\nOCHA CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\n5\\nMARCH 2023\\n30 UN (2021).

Applying Humanitarian Principles To Current Uses Of Information Communication Technologies: Gaps In Doctrine And \\n    Challenges To Practice.Signal Program on Human Security and Technology, Harvard Humanitarian Initiative.\\n3.\\t Human error \\nThere has been a discernible shift from hackers attacking servers, networks and devices to ‘hacking \\npeople’ in recent years.30 Ninety-five percent of cybersecurity breaches are now caused by human error.31 \\nSocial engineering techniques (phishing, impersonation, etc.) aimed at manipulating individuals into \\ndivulging sensitive information are the most prevalent means of exploiting this vulnerability. Most of these \\ntechniques are designed to reach a high number of users simultaneously, maximizing the likelihood of a \\nbreach. These intrusions can go undetected for extended periods of time, giving attackers access to internal \\nsecurity architecture and confidential information, which in turn offers further opportunities for attack.\\nHuman error that increases vulnerability to cyber threats may include: \\n•\\t accidental abuse by users with authorized and legitimate access to computer systems;\\n•\\t unauthorized use by attackers enabled by a compromised user;\\n \\n•\\t disregard by personnel for security policies and procedures; and \\n•\\t errors in the configuration or operation of systems.\\n4.\\t Absence of coordinated approach\\nThere is an acute gap in coordination on cyber-related issues in the humanitarian sector. This gap exists \\nboth within and between organizations. Few organizations have teams dedicated to cybersecurity or tasked \\nwith detecting, assessing and mitigating cyber risks. No single entity is formally tasked with coordinating \\na harmonized approach to cybersecurity in the sector, despite the existence of initiatives such as the ones \\ndescribed above, the development of resources and apparent political will.32 \\nThe lack of coordination means that organizations lack visibility on attacks experienced by their peers, are \\nunable or do not have policies in place to consistently share information on experienced cyber threats or \\nlessons learned, and are not investing in collective approaches to reducing vulnerabilities and mitigating \\nrisk.33\\nHUMANITARIAN IMPLICATIONS OF CYBER THREATS\\nThe humanitarian implications of cyber threats are significant. They can compromise the ability to deliver \\nassistance and protection, as well as exacerbate humanitarian needs by disrupting services essential \\nfor survival. Cyber threats can result in surveillance, discrimination, persecution and other harmful \\nconsequences for affected populations, exacerbate the insecurities of already vulnerable groups and \\nindividuals, erode trust and compromise the principled delivery of humanitarian assistance.34\\nDelivering principled aid means that humanitarian services and assistance are aligned with the \\nprinciples of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.35 To act with neutrality in the digital \\nrealm, humanitarian actors ‘must ensure that the data and systems they employ do not provide any \\ntactical military or operational advantage to parties engaged in hostilities’.36 The humanitarian principle \\nof independence might be in conflict with the dependence of ICT-supported humanitarian work on \\ninfrastructure owned and managed by private companies affiliated with different states. The overarching \\nprinciple of ‘Do No Harm’ further obliges all humanitarians to avoid exposing people to additional risks'"
